# Python Weather App with Tkinter â€“ Real-Time Weather Information

## Project Overview
This Python Weather App combines practical programming with a clean, user-friendly interface to display real-time weather data. Built using Tkinter for the graphical interface and the OpenWeatherMap API for live weather data, the project serves as an excellent showcase of API integration, error handling, and GUI development in Python.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Users enter a city to see the current temperature (in Celsius) and weather description.
- **Error Handling:** If a city is not found, the app displays a clear error message, ensuring user-friendly interaction.
- **Customizable Interface:** The design allows flexibility in color and window size, with a straightforward layout focused on ease of use.

## Technical Highlights
- **Python & Tkinter:** Tkinter provides a lightweight GUI, ideal for demonstrating core interface development skills in Python.
- **API Integration:** The OpenWeatherMap API is utilized to fetch and display live data, showcasing an understanding of handling HTTP requests and JSON responses.
- **Structured Code with OOP Concepts:** Modular functions make the code maintainable and easy to expand.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project reflects key technical and soft skills valuable to employers:
- **Problem Solving:** Developing a responsive app that handles user input, error states, and external data.
- **API & Data Handling:** Understanding of API calls, error handling, and parsing JSON responses.
- **User-Focused Design:** Designing a clean, intuitive interface aligned with user needs and expectations.
